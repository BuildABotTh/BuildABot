#Updates and status on the development and production

__WE ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - ALL PARTS ARE STILL EARLY UNDERDEVELOPMENT - PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RECREATE ANY FILES__
** Target release date is end of Q3 2024 (Delays are expected) **

##Current status:
Robot V0.13 - Designing and producing custom PCBs, finalizing mechanical designs 
Controller V0.02 - Testing design with physical prototype
Field V0.1 - Basic layout complete, awaiting start of trial production
Game elements V0.0 - Material testing

##Product roadmap:
Pilot testing with engineering prototypes of robots - Q3 2025
Small-scale in-house production of robots - Q4 2025
Small-scale in-house production of field and game elements - Q4.5 2025
__ Target robot initial release date - December 2025 __
Pilot testing and small-scale in-house production of controllers - Q1 2026
Development of other modules and robot upgrade paths - Q2 2026

##Current updates and progress:
  • Working on a custom PCB for the robot (In progress)
  • Wiring diagram for the robot (Basic diagram - Completed, Awaiting custom PCB)
  • Manufacturing basic working prototype (Awaiting custom PCB)
