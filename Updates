WE ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - ALL PARTS ARE STILL WORK IN PROGRESS - PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BUILD THE ROBOTS YET
Target release date is end of Q3 2024 (Delays are expected)

Current updates and progress:
  • Working on a custom PCB for the robot (In progress)
  • Wiring diagram for the robot (Basic diagram - Completed, Awaiting custom PCB)
  • Manufacturing basic working prototype (Awaiting custom PCB)

Change logs

Robot updates:
